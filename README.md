# Wallhaven-Extension

Not available on Chrome store yet - not fully polished, but you can load it unpacked.

Note:
Toggle button only hides the overlay, doesn't bring it back.
Replace the "trans_desktop.png" with a transparent screenshot of your desktop when using.
I didn't make an icon for it. It's a default "hello world" icon.
Overlay will stretch to match wallpaper dimensions, not a problem for most wallpapers.
